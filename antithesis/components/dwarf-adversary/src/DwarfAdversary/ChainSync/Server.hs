-- Module: DwarfAdversary.ChainSync.Server
--
-- A chain-sync /server/ (the upstream role): the cardano-node dials us
-- as a chain-sync client and we feed it 'SendMsgRollForward' for each
-- header we hold. Because the node decodes every header we serve, this
-- is the seam at which fuzzed header CBOR (via the mutating codec)
-- reaches the node's real header decoder.
