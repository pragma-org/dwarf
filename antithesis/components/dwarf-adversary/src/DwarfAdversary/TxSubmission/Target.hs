-- Module: DwarfAdversary.TxSubmission.Target
--
-- Sub-field-targeted CBOR mutation over the Conway transaction 'Term' layout.
-- A Conway tx Term is @TList [tx_body (TMap), witness_set, is_valid, aux_data]@.
-- The tx_body is a map keyed by small ints: certificates live at key @4@.
-- Auxiliary data is the tx array's element index 3.
--
-- IMPORTANT — envelope unwrapping. The bytes the codec hands us are NOT the bare
-- Conway tx array. @encTx = encodeNodeToNode \@Block@ wraps the era tx in the
-- HardFork node-to-node /GenTx envelope/: an era-disambiguation tag plus a
-- CBOR-in-CBOR (CBOR tag 24) byte string holding the real tx, i.e. roughly
-- @TList [TInt eraIndex, TTagged 24 (TBytes \<conway-tx\>)]@. A naive navigation
-- on the top-level Term therefore never sees @tx_body@ key 4 and silently falls
-- back to mutating the envelope. 'locateTxArray' descends through @TList@ /
-- @TListI@ structure and unwraps tag-24 byte strings to find the real tx array
-- (the array whose head is the @tx_body@ map, identified by key @0@ = inputs),
-- applies the targeted transform there, and re-encodes the unwrapped CBOR layers
-- on the way out so the result is a valid wire 'GenTx' again.
--
-- 'mutateTxField' selects the sub-'Term' to perturb by 'TxField' (from the
-- scenario's @--cbor-shape@), applies 'Fuzz.mutateTerm' to just that sub-Term,
-- and splices it back. The structural mutation engine is unchanged — only the
-- /target/ is selected. On a navigation miss (no tx array found, or the field is
-- absent) it falls back to mutating the whole top-level Term and records
-- @"fallback:"@ in the 'MutationInfo' kind, so a clean-but-untargeted mutation is
-- visible rather than silently dropped.
