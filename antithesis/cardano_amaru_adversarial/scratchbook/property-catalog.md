# Property Catalog

This targeted cycle extends one proven cross-implementation property along a
small semantic boundary. It is not a claim that the full Cardano/Amaru property
portfolio contains only this property.

## Transaction admission boundaries

### phase1-underfee-admission-agreement — Signed Minimum-Fee Corpus Agreement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Priority** | P0 for the next mixed run |
| **Status** | Original `-1` case completed in Antithesis; five-case preflight found Amaru rejects exact and `+1`; corpus run pending |
| **Type** | Safety plus liveness/reachability support |
| **Property** | For identical correctly signed Conway transactions at `minimum + {-100,-2,-1,0,+1}`, Cardano and Amaru return the manifest-declared outcome: negative deltas reject at phase 1, while exact minimum and `+1` accept. |
| **Invariant** | Corpus assertions require classifiable paired results to match the expected outcome and prohibit acceptance of every negative case. Case ID, delta, expectation, input, transaction ID, and both responses are attached to every evaluation. Reachability and `Sometimes` assertions prevent a vacuous green run. |
| **Antithesis Angle** | A `first_` command proves readiness with the replay-safe `-1` case and submits the two valid cases exactly once before faults. During faults, `antithesis.random.random_choice` selects only the three idempotent negative cases. An `eventually_` command selects one negative case and checks recovery after faults stop. Cardano remains a stable control. |
| **Why It Matters** | Different phase-1 admission decisions can produce mempool and block-validation divergence. This exercises a semantic ledger boundary that the existing decoder, rollback, diffusion, reconnect, and phase-2 reports do not cover. |

**Resolved reachability question:** the paired block-216 Cardano snapshot and baked
Amaru store both retain the fixture input. Cardano returns the exact fee mismatch;
Amaru returns its generic validation-layer error. A fresh configurator UTxO does not
match and must never be used for this property. The exact-minimum and `+1` cases use
separate retained inputs because accepted transactions cannot be replayed safely.

**Confirmed finding:** Amaru `v10.11.20260807` mempool validation charges the
full 201-byte standalone transaction while Cardano's ledger fee calculation uses
200 bytes without `is_valid`. The exact and `+1` cases therefore disagree, and a
controlled `+44` case is accepted by both. Each corpus case now has a separate
fixed assertion identity, so Antithesis will report reachability and correctness
without aggregate-property masking.

## Completed baseline run

The replacement one-hour run at public commit
`6082f0eedabe478801051a661435a5ffb3424f47` completed as Antithesis run
`0195e57647d3ee8322893e6f8af159a5-59-13` (MOOG test-run
`f1334b7d8425d76f219d62dd0c01f462e35c6faf9f987b11f6b86c2ad83a9bd7`).
It exercised only the original `-1` fixture.

- 43 of 44 reported properties passed. The only failure was the pre-existing
  Cardano `cluster fork depth < k` property, with 43 counterexamples; no new
  mixed admission issue was surfaced.
- The two mixed safety properties each recorded 155,608 passing examples.
- Paired classifiability was reached 148,003 times, and post-fault recovery
  recorded 3,775 passing examples.
- The fault injector ran, all test commands were discovered and completed, and
  both Amaru relays participated in network traffic.

## Assumptions

- Valid transactions run only in the fault-free `first_` phase and only once.
- Repeated and recovery commands select only negative, non-consuming cases.
- Selection uses Antithesis structured randomness at the decision point; no SDK
  random value is cached or used to seed another RNG.

## Open Questions

- After this corpus is exercised, the next fee work should cross a serialized-size
  transition or add another phase-1 rule rather than adding more nearby fee deltas.
