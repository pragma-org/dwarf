# Cardano Amaru Testnet

This testnet extends the `cardano_node_master` shape with an Amaru
bootstrap path:

- three `cardano-node` block producers pinned to the official
  `10.7.1-amd64` image digest;
- two relays, also pinned to the same node release;
- the published `amaru-bootstrap-producer` image from
  `lambdasistemi/amaru-bootstrap`;
- two relay-only Amaru nodes whose entrypoints wait until the producer
  has committed a complete `testnet_42` bootstrap bundle.

Amaru is not assigned stake in this testnet. The only stake-bearing block
producers are the three cardano-node services `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
`amaru-relay-1` and `amaru-relay-2` receive no KES key, VRF key, cold
key, operational certificate, or stake-pool genesis assignment.

This testnet uses a fast bootstrap profile:

```yaml
protocolConsts:
  k: 10
epochLength: 120
securityParam: 10
activeSlotsCoeff: 0.2
TestConwayHardForkAtEpoch: 0
```

The producer requires two complete Conway epochs behind the immutable
tip. These values make that proof bounded for local and CI runs without
changing the cardano-node release target or giving Amaru producer
credentials. Dense block production is part of the profile because the
producer reads immutable chunks only; sparse block production can leave
the immutable tip at genesis for too long.

The Amaru relay containers are intentionally quiet for Antithesis log
ingestion: compose sets `AMARU_LOG=warn`, `AMARU_TRACE=warn`, and
`AMARU_COLOR=never`, and the wrapper loops do not print polling
heartbeats. The bootstrap producer stores per-attempt logs under
`/srv/amaru/.logs` in the bundle volume and prints only the final commit
line or a bounded tail for a non-retryable failure.

The producer image is pinned by full source commit SHA:

```text
ghcr.io/lambdasistemi/amaru-bootstrap-producer:pr-32-ad64e76778b0408ec66f353c7e58c8a1e7d4045f
```

The cardano-node release image is pinned in Compose by digest only:

```text
ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node@sha256:3275d357053d21f3220f74b0854fd584e1fe322dfa1bbb78effd760c3191d14c
```

That digest is the manifest digest for the upstream
`ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:10.7.1-amd64` tag. Compose must not
use the Docker-valid `repo:tag@sha256:digest` spelling here because the
Antithesis image parameter validator accepts image names by tag or by
digest, but rejects the combined tag-plus-digest form before the cluster
is built.

The generic observability and assertion services remain enabled:
`tracer`, `tracer-sidecar`, `log-tailer`, and `sidecar`. The
transaction perturbator workload is deliberately absent; this testnet has
no `tx-generator` service.

## Mixed Cardano/Amaru phase-1 fee corpus

The adversarial bundle also contains a stable Cardano phase-1 reference, the two
Amaru relays, and a same-byte differential workload. Its signed public corpus is:

| case | delta from minimum | expected outcome | scheduling |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `underfee-minus-100` | -100 | phase-1 rejection | replayable under faults |
| `underfee-minus-2` | -2 | phase-1 rejection | replayable under faults |
| `underfee-minus-1` | -1 | phase-1 rejection | replayable; historical baseline |
| `minimum-exact` | 0 | acceptance | exactly once before faults |
| `minimum-plus-1` | +1 | acceptance | exactly once before faults |

Antithesis runs `first_fee_valid_boundaries.py` after setup and before fault
injection. It first proves both submission endpoints are ready with the invalid
`-1` case, then sends each valid transaction once. Accepted transactions are
never placed in repeatable commands because replay would test spent-input or
duplicate behavior instead of the fee boundary.

During faults, `parallel_driver_underfee_corpus.py` calls
`antithesis.random.random_choice` over only the three negative cases. The
eventual recovery command does the same after fault injection stops. Every
assertion includes the case ID, fee delta, expected result, input, transaction
ID, and both endpoint observations. The original `-1` assertion names remain so
results can be compared with the completed baseline run.

The fixture directory contains only signed transaction envelopes and public
metadata. It must never contain signing keys or mount genesis key material.

## Runtime Flow

```text
configurator -> p1/p2/p3/relay1/relay2
                  |
                  v
             p1 ChainDB
                  |
                  v
      bootstrap-producer refresh loop
                  |
                  v
          bootstrap ChainDB copy
                  |
                  v
           amaru-bundle volume
             |             |
             v             v
      amaru-relay-1   amaru-relay-2
              \           /
               \         /
                v       v
             amaru-consumer
```

`bootstrap-producer` owns the snapshot-refresh loop. It mounts `p1`'s
live ChainDB read-only at `/live`, copies it into the isolated
`bootstrap-state` volume, then mounts that copy read-write at
`/cardano/state` for the upstream producer command. This preserves the
cardano-node 10.7.1 consensus API requirement that immutable chunk
validation has write permissions, while avoiding writes to the live `p1`
ChainDB during Antithesis fault scheduling. Retryable readiness and copy
failures use a short per-attempt deadline and refresh the snapshot inside
the same container instead of exiting non-zero. Expected `cp` races
against the live ledger directory are kept in the Amaru bundle logs, not
container stdout.

Each relay-only Amaru entrypoint copies the final bundle into its private
state volume before it execs `amaru run`, so the two Amaru nodes do not
share writable chain or ledger stores. The relays peer directly with
cardano-node producers (`amaru-relay-1` to `p1`, `amaru-relay-2` to
`p2`) and also serve the isolated `amaru-consumer` path described below.

## Amaru Consumer Path

`amaru-consumer` is a cardano-node relay that starts from the Amaru
bootstrap seed and then must catch up through Amaru. Its topology is
`amaru-consumer-topology.json`, whose only local roots are
`amaru-relay-1.example` and `amaru-relay-2.example`; it has no public
roots and no direct producer or cardano-node relay peers.

`amaru-consumer-seed` copies the `bootstrap-state` volume into
`amaru-consumer-state` after `bootstrap-producer` exits successfully.
`amaru-consumer` mounts that seeded state as its ChainDB, but it is
attached only to `amaru-consumer-net`. The two Amaru relays are attached
to both the producer network and `amaru-consumer-net`, so they are the
only route by which the consumer can advance past its seed point.

For `cardano_amaru`, the smoke captures the consumer's first readable tip
as `N0`, then fails unless the consumer advances to a slot greater than
`N0` and its tip hash matches `p1`. On timeout, crash, restart, or
divergence, the smoke prints the consumer tip, the `p1` tip, `N0`, and a
tail of the `amaru-consumer` logs before exiting non-zero.

Each relay also writes a startup marker into the shared `amaru-startup`
volume immediately before the `amaru run` exec. The sidecar mounts that
volume, and its image contains the Amaru startup proof scripts in the
existing `convergence` Test Composer template so Antithesis can score
`parallel_driver_amaru_started.sh` and `finally_amaru_started.sh` as
explicit properties instead of asking readers to infer startup from
container background-monitor logs. In this profile the sidecar also
waits for those markers before emitting Antithesis setup-complete, so
fault injection starts only after Amaru has consumed the bootstrap bundle
at least once.

## Local Commands

Validate the Compose model:

```bash
INTERNAL_NETWORK=false docker compose -f testnets/cardano_amaru/docker-compose.yaml config
```

Run the standard node smoke test:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-test.sh cardano_amaru 600
```

The standard smoke test proves the cardano-node network and sidecar
convergence checks still start. Because this profile has no
`tx-generator`, the generic tx-generator smoke gate is skipped. For
`cardano_amaru`, the smoke waits for `bootstrap-producer` to complete,
checks that both relay-only Amaru nodes copied the bundle into private
state and stayed running after `amaru run` opened the stores, then proves
`amaru-consumer` advanced past its seeded tip and converged to a producer
tip through the Amaru-only topology.

For the bootstrap-specific proof, inspect:

```bash
docker compose -f testnets/cardano_amaru/docker-compose.yaml logs -f bootstrap-producer
docker compose -f testnets/cardano_amaru/docker-compose.yaml ps bootstrap-producer amaru-relay-1 amaru-relay-2
```

Expected completion sequence:

1. `bootstrap-producer` prints `wrote /srv/amaru/testnet_42` and exits
   `0`.
2. `amaru-relay-1` and `amaru-relay-2` copy the bundle into their private state
   volumes.
3. `amaru-relay-1` and `amaru-relay-2` start with `amaru run` and stay
   running without a restart during the smoke gate.
4. The sidecar setup signal is delayed until both relay startup markers
   exist.
5. `parallel_driver_amaru_started.sh` emits `amaru_relays_started` when
   it samples both relay startup markers; `finally_amaru_started.sh`
   fails the run if those markers are still missing at the final check.
   Both commands run from the `convergence` template so Antithesis does
   not mix separate test directories in one sidecar.
6. The sidecar uses a larger post-fault convergence budget in this
   profile (`30s` settle, `15` attempts, `3s` delay) so a final check is
   not scored while producer tips are still catching up after faults
   stop.

## Compatibility Constraint

This stack intentionally targets cardano-node 10.7.1. The Amaru
bootstrap CBOR projection is release-sensitive, so a green compile
against a different ledger dependency set is not evidence that the
runtime bytes are compatible with this cluster.

## Image Entrypoint Contract

### Historical image-identity answer

The earlier local-versus-Antithesis discrepancy was an image identity
discrepancy, not different command semantics. The failed fresh-local
probe observed a Dockerfile-shaped `e01ad90` image with no entrypoint
and `Cmd=["/usr/local/tracer-sidecar","/opt/cardano-tracer/logs"]`.
The completed Antithesis run
`5271f5ea22ddde7a6f674084905aa335-56-17` used consumer commit
`95306662` and tracer-sidecar manifest digest
`sha256:9c7fc575e32c0ca2789fa507632a7ba040b160c2bdeb4251f872e26390e3192a`.
That exact registry manifest has `Entrypoint=["tracer-sidecar"]` and
no `Cmd`; the run logged `starting tracer-sidecar...` and emitted two
`cluster fork depth < k` counterexamples from
`tracer-sidecar.example`. The mutable `e01ad90` tag named differently
built or cached local and registry artifacts.

### Released command

```bash
./scripts/check-compose-image-entrypoint.sh \
  -f <compose-file> [-f <override> ...] \
  --service <service> \
  --expected-argv '<JSON string array>' \
  [--image <repository>@sha256:<64-hex-digest>]
```

- Repeated `-f` is accepted; at least one is required.
- `--service` and `--expected-argv` are required.
- `--expected-argv` must be a JSON array of strings.
- `--image`, when present, must be an exact lowercase
  `repository@sha256:<64 hex>` reference. Sibling #208 supplies it to
  bind a pre-launch digest set.
- Omitting `--image` pulls and checks the image rendered by Compose.

### Output contract

On success, stdout contains exactly one canonical JSON line identified
by `schema: "compose-image-entrypoint/v1"`. Human progress and
diagnostics go to stderr. The stable field set is:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | string | Always `compose-image-entrypoint/v1` |
| `target_count` | number | Discovered service count (non-zero on success) |
| `service` | string | The checked service name |
| `declared_image` | string | Image from rendered Compose |
| `checked_image` | string | Declared image or exact override |
| `resolved_digest` | string | `repository@sha256:<digest>` from inspected metadata |
| `image_id` | string | `sha256:<id>` of the pulled image |
| `image_entrypoint` | array/null | Image `Entrypoint` |
| `image_cmd` | array/null | Image `Cmd` |
| `compose_entrypoint` | array/null | Rendered Compose `entrypoint` |
| `compose_command` | array/null | Rendered Compose `command` |
| `runtime_argv` | array | Actual container `Path` + `Args` |
| `state` | string | Container state (`running` on success) |

Zero targets, malformed or non-digest overrides, missing
digest/metadata, argv mismatch, startup or early-exit, and incomplete
cleanup are non-zero failures.

### Release signal

Exit zero is the release signal. Sibling #208 treats any non-zero exit
as a launch-blocking interface alarm. Changing the command surface,
field set, or field meaning requires a new ticket-owner ruling.

The `cardano_amaru` smoke path
(`scripts/smoke-test.sh cardano_amaru ...`) invokes the focused check
before full stack startup, providing shared local and hosted
reachability through the existing standalone and publish-images
workflows.
