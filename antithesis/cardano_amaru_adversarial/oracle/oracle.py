"""DWARF adversarial differential oracle for the mixed Amaru net.

Two Amaru relays bootstrap from the same store, then:
  - amaru-relay-2 peers the HONEST cardano relay  -> control (adopts the real chain)
  - amaru-relay-1 peers the DWARF ADVERSARY       -> fed mutated / forged block CBOR

This oracle tails both relays' logs (shared amaru-logs volume) and emits Antithesis
SDK properties that formalize the differential:

  always     amaru-relay-1 never adopts a tip that is NOT on the honest chain
             (no forged-fork adoption) — the core safety property.
  always     amaru-relay-1 never gets AHEAD of the honest tip height (can only
             advance via forged blocks, since its sole peer is the adversary).
  always     neither Amaru relay panics / logs a fatal error under adversarial input.
  sometimes  amaru-relay-1 rejected a forged block at decode (the adversary is
             actually exercising Amaru's decoder — the test is really adversarial).
  sometimes  amaru-relay-2 advanced the honest chain (liveness works alongside the attack).

A failing `always` = Amaru accepted something forged that the honest node did not
= a real finding. The SDK is optional so the container is runnable locally.
