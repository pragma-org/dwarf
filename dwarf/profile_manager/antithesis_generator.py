"""Scenario -> native Antithesis test generator (cardano-node).

Pure, stdlib-only (string-built YAML/JSON, matching the rest of the package).
Turns a validated DWARF scenario into a native Antithesis bundle and statically
verifies it (Stage-2 gate) before any Moog submission. cardano-node only;
amaru/differential are refused (SP3).

Native conventions honored (see profile_manager.antithesis_conventions):
  - SDK assertions: Sometimes/Reachable only (harness can chaos-kill the
    workload, so Always would false-fail).
  - antithesis_random seeds the adversary --seed at launch (reproducible).
  - composer scripts under /opt/antithesis/test/v1/; parallel_driver_ emits no
    setup_complete.
  - com.antithesis.exclude_from_faults on the rig (not the node under test).
  - public, registry-pinned, hermetic images (no build: contexts).

The "overlap" with the local-devnet backend is honest: both attack the SAME
target decoder under the SAME asserted property from the SAME seed source. The
mutation ENGINES differ by design -- local cbor_fuzz_structured is byte-level
mutate_cbor; the native dwarf-adversary is Term-level structural mutateTerm.
