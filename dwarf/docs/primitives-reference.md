# DWARF Primitives Reference

The complete catalogue of the **233** primitives a scenario can reference — every *strategy* (what a scenario can do) and every *oracle* (what it can assert). Generated from `primitives/registry.json`; purposes/pass-conditions are curated. A scenario may only reference names listed here. Many primitives operate on CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), Cardano's binary wire and ledger encoding. The **Antithesis** column marks the primitives the DWARF&rarr;Antithesis generator can carry onto the Antithesis backend (CBOR-only by design &mdash; `cbor_fuzz_*` strategies, the `runtime_aflpp_campaign` coverage surface, and the assertions mapped to native SDK checks); everything else runs on the local backend only.

> Coverage: 206/233 primitives carry a curated description (88%). Any without one is still listed with its registry metadata. Regenerate with `scripts/gen_reference.py`.

The browser catalog at `/operate/primitives` is the source-backed inventory for registry metadata, parameter schemas, executor provenance, scenario references, and deterministic source export. `/learn/primitives` documents the code-change lifecycle. A primitive is executable code; it is not a corpus, generation grammar, target, profile, or scenario.

> Every registry record resolves to a built-in executor class and a parseable parameter schema in this revision. That is catalog validity, not runtime-execution proof. The **verified** column is the separate evidence-of-exercise statement: `full` = exercised by a full scenario, `smoke` = exercised by an example / smoke scenario; `cn` = cardano-node, `amaru` = Amaru. So `smoke · cn` means "exercised at smoke depth on cardano-node" — not a completeness claim. Note on targets: the registry declares cardano-node + Amaru support broadly, but Amaru is currently *verified* only on the CBOR-decode surfaces and a mixed-substrate baseline (19 primitives); elsewhere it is registered but not yet exercised against Amaru. Computed from `scenarios/` at build time.

Every primitive lists which **runtimes** it works in (`library` / `single-node` / `devnet`) and its **verified** status &mdash; the depth and target it has actually been exercised against (see the legend below). Common plumbing params (`timeout_seconds`, `output_dir`, `runtime_metadata_path`, `helper_script`) are omitted from the notes below; see each primitive's `params_schema` for the full list.
