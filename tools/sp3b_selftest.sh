# SP3b tx-submission selftest: build the adversary and run the tx-submission
# selftest — the Initiator+Responder server binds, accepts a connection, the
# responders serve, and the #4 tx-provider initiator is wired + drives (opens
# mini-protocol #4). Proves the IR-on-inbound wiring locally with 0 crash. The
# minimal selftest client is chain-sync-only, so it reports UnknownMiniProtocol
# 4 when our #4 initiator opens toward it — EXPECTED; a real cardano-node has a
# #4 consumer that accepts the offer (proven by the live run). Run on cardano-box.
