# SP3-foundation local validation: does the advancing CaughtUp peer make the
# node start tx-submission? Brings up the tx adversary (advancing chain-sync
# producer + roll-forward server) + a fresh relay2 (sole peer = adversary).
# The producer syncs the upstream chain to its RECENT tip, the advancing server
# keeps relay2 at that tip -> relay2 reaches GSM CaughtUp -> after the 60s
# tx-submission init delay it sends MsgRequestTxIds. The adversary logs that as
# "tx-submission: offering" (txs present) or "batch exhausted; parking" (empty
# batch — local chain has no txs, but the REQUEST arriving is the proof).
#
# SUCCESS = RequestTxIds-received > 0 with RestartCount 0. Before this fix
# (5-header static chain) it was 0 (relay2 looped FindIntersect->reset, never
# CaughtUp). Run on cardano-box.
