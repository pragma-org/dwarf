# FU1 reject-oracle (local analysis). Classifies how the node-under-test (relay2)
# responded to the mutated CBOR the adversary served, from relay2's tracer:
#   - decode-reject   : DecoderFailure / ShutdownPeer scoped to the adversary peer
#   - validation-reject: ChainDB/consensus InvalidBlock / invalid events
#   - ADOPTED          : blocks relay2 added to its chain (AddedToCurrentChain /
#                        SwitchedToAFork). Under ECLIPSE the adversary is relay2's
#                        ONLY peer, so any adopted block came from the adversary —
#                        adopting a MUTATED block would be an acceptance FINDING.
# Verdict: served>0 AND decode-reject>0 AND adopted==0  => node correctly REJECTS,
# never accepts (reject-oracle holds). adopted>0 under eclipse => investigate.
# Run on cardano-box against a live eclipse stack. Arg: adversary peer IP (default 172.31.0.8).
