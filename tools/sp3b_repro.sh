# SP3b-fix tx-submission stability — local testnet repro / verification gate.
# Brings up the cardano_node_dwarf testnet FRESH (producers p1/p2/p3 have
# ephemeral chain DBs; relay1/relay2 state volumes are wiped) so it mirrors a
# real Antithesis run: the tx-generator submits into a from-genesis chain, so
# early blocks carry real txs for getBaseTxs to capture. The tx-submission
# adversary (PROVIDER) captures those txs and serves seeded mutations; relay2
# dials the adversary and runs N2N tx-submission as the consumer.
#
# Verifies the adversary STAYS ALIVE across protocol completion / peer churn:
#   - RestartCount stays 0 over a sustained window (the pre-fix bug was an
#     exit-1 crash-loop, RestartCount climbing into the thousands), AND
#   - it actually served at least one tx ("tx-submission: serving") and then
#     kept running (looped back to idle / parked) instead of sending Done.
# Run on cardano-box. Set ADV_TAG to the adversary image tag to test.
