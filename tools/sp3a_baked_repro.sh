# SP3a BAKED (producer-less eclipse) local gate. Brings up the
# cardano_node_dwarf_baked bundle: NO producers, NO configurator — relay2
# (node under test) has ONLY the dwarf-adversary as a peer (eclipsed by
# construction, single network, NO custom docker network -> Antithesis-safe).
# The adversary serves a BAKED chain (embedded baked-blocks.cbor) paired with
# the FIXED genesis in ./configs it was forged under; relay2 bootstraps from
# origin (valid headers, 0 VRFKeyBadProof) and block-fetches MUTATED bodies ->
# the block decoder runs on them (dwarf_served_mutated_block). SUCCESS =
# loadBakedChain loaded N>0, dwarf_served_mutated_block>0, VRFKeyBadProof 0,
# adversary RestartCount 0. Run on cardano-box.
