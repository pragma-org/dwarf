# SP3a-eclipse local validation gate. Brings up the cardano_node_dwarf testnet
# with the ECLIPSE override (docker-compose.eclipse.yml): the node under test
# (relay2) is on an isolated network reaching ONLY the dwarf-adversary, which
# bridges both nets (default to chain-sync its upstream p1, eclipse to serve
# relay2). The adversary runs --protocol blockfetch: it serves VALID headers
# (relay2 adopts -> the from-origin Praos nonce bootstrap works under eclipse,
# 0 VRFKeyBadProof) and MUTATED block bodies, which relay2 — having no other
# peer — block-fetches and decodes (dwarf_served_mutated_block). This is the
# SP3a fuzzing seam that approach-B dual-peer could not fire (relay2 fetched
# bodies only from the trusted producers). SUCCESS = dwarf_served_mutated_block
# > 0 with RestartCount 0 and relay2 reaching exactly 1 peer (the adversary).
# Run on cardano-box. Arg: adversary image tag (default 0.8.0).
